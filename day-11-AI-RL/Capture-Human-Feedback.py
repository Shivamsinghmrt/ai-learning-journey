# Exercise 2 : Capture Human Feedback

# Tool: Colab or VS Code + OpenAI key     

# Problem Statement: Before an agent can improve from human feedback, you need to collect that feedback cleanly. Generate an answer from the model, rate it, and store the rating in a structured log you could later use to train or steer the agent.

# Goal of the Problem: Build the first half of a feedback loop — the data-collection layer that every RLHF-style system depends on.

# Step 1. Generate an answer from the model.

import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv
load_dotenv()
from openai import OpenAI

 

client = OpenAI(api_key=os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"])

 

prompt = "Explain what an AI agent is, in 2 sentences."

resp = client.chat.completions.create(

   model="gpt-4o-mini",

   messages=[{"role": "user", "content": prompt}],

)

answer = resp.choices[0].message.content

print(answer)

# Expected output

# An AI agent is a software system that perceives its environment,

# makes decisions toward a goal, and takes actions using tools or APIs.

# Unlike a single prompt, it can plan, call functions, and adapt across

# multiple steps.

# (Your exact wording will vary — the model is non-deterministic.)

# Step 2. Record a thumbs-up / thumbs-down rating with an optional note.

feedback_log = []

 

def record_feedback(prompt, answer, rating, note=""):

   feedback_log.append({

       "prompt": prompt,

       "answer": answer,

       "rating": rating,          # "up" or "down"

       "note": note,

   })

   print(f"Recorded: {rating} | note: {note or 'none'}")

 

# Try it — react to the answer you just saw:

record_feedback(prompt, answer, "up", "Clear and concise")

# Expected output

# Recorded: up | note: Clear and concise

# Step 3. Persist the feedback so it survives the session.

import json

 

with open("feedback_log.json", "w") as f:

   json.dump(feedback_log, f, indent=2)

 

print(json.dumps(feedback_log, indent=2))

# Expected output

 

# [

#  {

#    "prompt": "Explain what an AI agent is, in 2 sentences.",

#    "answer": "An AI agent is a software system that...",

#    "rating": "up",

#    "note": "Clear and concise"

#  }
