# The Self-Tuning Agent

# Tool: Colab or VS Code + OpenAI key     

# Problem Statement: Users complain an assistant is too wordy. Instead of editing prompts by hand, give the agent a small behaviour state (answer length, temperature) and a rule that adjusts it in response to a signal like “too_long”.

# Goal of the Problem: See adaptive behaviour tuning: the same agent produces measurably different output after a single feedback signal, without you rewriting the prompt.

# Step 1. Define the agent with a tunable behaviour state.

import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv
load_dotenv()
from openai import OpenAI

 

client = OpenAI(api_key=os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"])

 

# The agent's tunable "behaviour state"

state = {"max_words": 60, "temperature": 0.7}

 

def ask(question, state):

   system = f"Answer in at most {state['max_words']} words."

   resp = client.chat.completions.create(

       model="gpt-4o-mini",

        temperature=state["temperature"],

       messages=[

           {"role": "system", "content": system},

           {"role": "user", "content": question},

       ],

   )

   return resp.choices[0].message.content

# Expected output: nothing yet — you've only defined the function.

# Step 2. Add the adaptation rule and watch the answer shrink.

def adapt(state, feedback):

   if feedback == "too_long":

       state["max_words"] = max(20, state["max_words"] - 20)

   elif feedback == "too_short":

       state["max_words"] += 20

   elif feedback == "too_random":

       state["temperature"] = max(0.0, state["temperature"] - 0.2)

   return state

 

q = "What is reinforcement learning?"

print("STATE:", state)

print(ask(q, state))

 

state = adapt(state, "too_long")      # user signal -> agent tunes itself

print("STATE:", state)

print(ask(q, state))

# Expected output

 

# STATE: {'max_words': 60, 'temperature': 0.7}

# Reinforcement learning is a training approach where an agent learns by

# trial and error, receiving rewards for good actions and penalties for

# bad ones, gradually improving its policy to maximise long-term reward.

 

# STATE: {'max_words': 40, 'temperature': 0.7}

# Reinforcement learning trains an agent through trial and error: it takes

# actions, receives rewards, and updates its strategy to earn more reward.

# (Second answer is noticeably shorter — the agent adapted.)
