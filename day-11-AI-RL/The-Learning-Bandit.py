#  (Quick Win): The Learning Bandit

# Tool: Colab or VS Code (pure Python)     

# Problem Statement: An agent must choose between three response strategies.
#  It cannot see how good each one is — it can only try one, observe whether it earned a reward, 
# and remember. Build an agent that learns, purely from reward, which strategy is best.

# Goal of the Problem: Experience the core reinforcement-learning loop (action → reward → update) 
# and see exploration vs exploitation in action, with no API and no libraries beyond NumPy.

# Step 1. Create the environment and the agent's beliefs.

import numpy as np

 

np.random.seed(42)

 

# Hidden "true" success rate of 3 agent response strategies

true_rates = [0.2, 0.5, 0.75]

n_arms = len(true_rates)

 

q_values = np.zeros(n_arms)   # what the agent BELIEVES each arm is worth

counts   = np.zeros(n_arms)   # how many times each arm was tried

 

epsilon = 0.1                 # 10% of the time: explore

n_steps = 2000

rewards = []

 

for _ in range(n_steps):

   if np.random.random() < epsilon:

       arm = np.random.randint(n_arms)      # EXPLORE a random arm

   else:

       arm = int(np.argmax(q_values))       # EXPLOIT the best-known arm

 

   reward = 1 if np.random.random() < true_rates[arm] else 0

   counts[arm] += 1

   q_values[arm] += (reward - q_values[arm]) / counts[arm]   # running average

   rewards.append(reward)

 

print("Estimated values:  ", np.round(q_values, 3))

print("Times each arm used:", counts.astype(int))

print("Best arm learned:  ", int(np.argmax(q_values)))

print("Average reward:    ", round(float(np.mean(rewards)), 3))

# Expected output

# Estimated values:   [0.214 0.513 0.751]

# Times each arm used: [  84   78 1838]

# Best arm learned:   2

# Average reward:     0.72

# Step 2. Visualise the learning curve (optional but satisfying).

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

 

running_avg = np.cumsum(rewards) / (np.arange(n_steps) + 1)

plt.plot(running_avg)

plt.xlabel("Step"); plt.ylabel("Average reward so far")

plt.title("Agent learning to prefer the best strategy")

plt.show()

# Expected output: a line that climbs from ~0.5 toward ~0.75 and flattens — the agent is earning more reward per step as it locks onto arm 2.
