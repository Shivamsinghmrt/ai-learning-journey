# Challenge 4B: A Customer-Support Triage Agent

# Challenge  •  ~35 minutes

# Problem Statement: Build a support agent with two domain tools: it looks up an order, checks refund eligibility, and replies to the customer — chaining the tools automatically.

 

# Goal of the Problem: Give an agent real business tools and a role, then let it orchestrate a multi-step task end-to-end. This is how internal 'copilot' agents are built.

 

# Step 1.  Define two custom domain tools over a mock order database.

# Good news! Your Wireless Mouse was purchased 10 days ago, so it is

# within our 30-day window and eligible for a full refund...

 

# --- A1002 ---

# Thanks for reaching out. Your Mechanical Keyboard was purchased 45

# days ago, which is past our 30-day refund window, so it is not

# eligible for a refund...
