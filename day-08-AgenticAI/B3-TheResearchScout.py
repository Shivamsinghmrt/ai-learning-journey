# 3B: The Research Scout

 

# Problem Statement: Turn the single lookup into a 'scout' agent that researches a topic by making several external lookups and then synthesises a crisp stakeholder brief.

 

# Goal of the Problem: Combine external tools + a multi-turn loop + synthesis. This is the 'scout' agent pattern used for research assistants.

 

# Step 1.  Reuse wiki_summary from 3A, then build a loop that lets the agent search several times before writing.

# Expected output

 

#  [scout searched] Large_language_model

#  [scout searched] GPT-3

#  [scout searched] Transformer_(deep_learning_architecture)

# - LLMs are neural networks trained on huge text corpora...

# - The Transformer architecture (2017) made them scalable...

# - GPT-3 (2020) showed few-shot capabilities...

# - Impact spans search, coding, and customer support...

# - Key risks: hallucination, cost, and data governance.
