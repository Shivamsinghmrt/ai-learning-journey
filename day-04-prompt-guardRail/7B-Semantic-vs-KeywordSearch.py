# Hands-On 7B · Stretch — Semantic vs Keyword Search 

# Problem Statement:  Your current help-search matches keywords, so 'my card won't work when I pay' returns nothing useful because the help article says 'declined at a shop'. You want to show where semantic search wins. 

# Goal of the Problem:  Build a tiny corpus and run both a keyword search and a semantic search on the same query, and compare the top result of each. 

# Where to run: VS Code or Colab   ·   Est. time: 25 min   ·   Concepts: semantic vs keyword search 

# Step 1 — Create a small help corpus 

import numpy as np 
import pandas as pd

import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv
from openai import OpenAI

load_dotenv()                     # reads .env into environment variables

client = OpenAI(api_key=os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY"))

  

corpus = [ 

    "To block a lost debit card, call our 24x7 helpline or use the app.", 

    "Savings account minimum balance is 5000 rupees in metro branches.", 

    "If your card is declined at a shop, check your daily transaction limit.", 

    "Home loan foreclosure has no penalty for floating-rate loans.", 

] 

  

def embed(texts): 

    r = client.embeddings.create(model="text-embedding-3-small", input=texts) 

    return np.array([d.embedding for d in r.data]) 

  

def cosine(a, b): 

    return float(np.dot(a, b) / (np.linalg.norm(a) * np.linalg.norm(b))) 

# Expected output 

# # defines corpus, embed(), cosine(); no output 

# Step 2 — Keyword search (word overlap) 

query = "my card won't work when I pay" 

q_words = set(query.lower().replace("'", "").split()) 

  

kw_ranked = sorted( 

    [(len(q_words & set(doc.lower().split())), doc) for doc in corpus], 

    reverse=True, 

) 

print("KEYWORD top overlap:", kw_ranked[0][0], "words") 

print("KEYWORD top result :", kw_ranked[0][1]) 

# Expected output 

# KEYWORD top overlap: 1 words 

# KEYWORD top result : To block a lost debit card, call our 24x7 helpline or use the app. 

# Keyword search latches onto the shared word 'card' and returns the blocking article — not the one about a card being declined at payment. 

# Step 3 — Semantic search (cosine over embeddings) 

corpus_vecs = embed(corpus) 

q_vec = embed([query])[0] 

  

sem_ranked = sorted( 

    [(cosine(q_vec, corpus_vecs[i]), corpus[i]) for i in range(len(corpus))], 

    reverse=True, 

) 

print("SEMANTIC top score :", round(sem_ranked[0][0], 3)) 

print("SEMANTIC top result:", sem_ranked[0][1]) 

# Expected output 

# SEMANTIC top score : 0.52 

# SEMANTIC top result: If your card is declined at a shop, check your daily transaction limit. 

# Takeaway:  Keyword search matches strings; semantic search matches meaning. For natural-language questions that rarely reuse the exact words in your docs, semantic retrieval wins — which is why RAG is built on it.
