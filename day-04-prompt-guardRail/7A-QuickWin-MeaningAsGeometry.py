# Problem Statement:  You keep hearing that embeddings 'capture meaning', but it sounds like magic. You want to see two differently-worded sentences score as similar and an unrelated one score as distant. 

# Goal of the Problem:  Embed a few sentences with text-embedding-3-small and use cosine similarity to measure how close their meanings are. 

# Where to run: VS Code or Colab   ·   Est. time: 15 min   ·   Concepts: embeddings, cosine similarity 

# Step 1 — Write helper functions to embed and compare 

import numpy as np 
import pandas as pd

import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv
from openai import OpenAI

load_dotenv()                     # reads .env into environment variables

client = OpenAI(api_key=os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY"))

  

def embed(texts): 

    r = client.embeddings.create(model="text-embedding-3-small", input=texts) 

    return np.array([d.embedding for d in r.data]) 

  

def cosine(a, b): 

    return float(np.dot(a, b) / (np.linalg.norm(a) * np.linalg.norm(b))) 

# Expected output 

# # defines embed() and cosine(); no output 

# Step 2 — Embed sentences and check the vector size 

sentences = [ 

    "How do I reset my password?",     # 0 

    "I forgot my login credentials",   # 1  (same meaning, different words) 

    "What time does the branch close?",# 2  (unrelated) 

] 

vecs = embed(sentences) 

print("Vectors shape:", vecs.shape)   # (rows, dimensions) 

# Expected output 

# Vectors shape: (3, 1536) 

# Step 3 — Compare meanings 

print("sim(0,1) reset vs forgot login :", round(cosine(vecs[0], vecs[1]), 3)) 

print("sim(0,2) reset vs branch hours  :", round(cosine(vecs[0], vecs[2]), 3)) 

# Expected output 

# sim(0,1) reset vs forgot login : 0.71 

# sim(0,2) reset vs branch hours  : 0.18 

# (exact numbers vary slightly, but 0,1 will be clearly higher than 0,2) 

# Takeaway:  Similar meaning = closer vectors, even with no shared words. That single idea is the engine under semantic search and RAG.
