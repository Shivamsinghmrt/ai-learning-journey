# Hands-On 2A — The Temperature Dial (Code Based)

# Problem Statement: A colleague insists the model 'says something different every time'. You need to show when that is true, when it isn't, and which knob controls it.

# Goal of the Problem: Call the Chat Completions endpoint at low and high temperature and watch determinism vs variety with your own eyes.

# Where to run: VS Code or Colab 

# Step 1 — Make your first Chat Completions call

# A request is a list of messages with roles. The system message sets behaviour; the user message is the request.

)

print(resp.choices[0].message.content.strip())

# Expected output

# "Grow your savings, secure your future — start today."

# (your exact wording will differ, but it will be a single tagline)

# Step 2 — Compare low vs high temperature, twice each
